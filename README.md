## **F2Py Sockets**
### A minimal working example on how to use sockets to transfer data from Fortran to Python and viceversa
This repository shows how to pass a n-dimensional array from Fortran to Python and viceversa. The Fortran `fsockets.f90` (wrapper of the `sockets.c`), the driver.f90 and the `socket.py` files were found in the [i-pi](https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi) repository (see for further functionalities). Here  the `driver.f90` and the `sockets.py` files have been modified to show a simple example on how to easily transfer data.

### How it works
A socket is created in Python allowing remote connections on a certain `port` and `address`
~~~~
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 	# Creates INET socket with TCP protocol
server.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)   # Set socket options
server.bind((self.address, self.port))	# What addresses and port does the socket listen to
server.listen(1) # How many connection requests do we allow at the same time
~~~~
Now a socket has been opened by the server and can be contacted by the remote socket, our driver, _a.k.a_ client (`driver.f90`). The remote socket needs to be opened in Fortran using the `fsockets.f90` wrapper of the `sockets.c`. We only need to use the wrapper as follows
~~~~
call open_socket(socket, inet, port, host)
~~~~
where `socket` is the socket id, `inet` is the TCP protocol specification, `port` is the port number and `host` is the server address.

From the server (Python) side, we need to accept the Fortran connection. For example,
~~~~
while True:
    # accept connections from outside
    (client, address) = server.accept()
    # now do something with the clientsocket, for example send a message
    client.sendall("A message!".encode())
~~~~

### Requirements
`python3.x` and `numpy` required. For older Python versions (2.x) check the `python_2.7` branch. The main difference is found in the creation of a `socket` object from another `socket` object.


Fortran and C compilers also required. Works fine with `gfortran` and `gcc` respectively. The Fortran compiler choice is specifically important for the declaration of single/double precision variables in Fortran for which the (e.g.) `real(kind=4)` standard is used instead of `real*4`.


### Usage
Run the Python server with
~~~~
cd python
python main.py
~~~~
The Fortran driver needs to be compiled first:
~~~~
cd ../fortran
make
~~~~
And now you can run it with
~~~~
./driver.x
~~~~
The driver should now be able to find the server socket. And the data will start transfering from Fortran to Python and viceversa.

### Note
The host name in /etc/hosts must be the same as that in /etc/hostname. 

If you want to transfer data across devices, you should set the correct IP address before the host name in /etc/hosts.

The default port is set to 31415, So the device which runs the python code needs to open this port by 
ufw allow IP to any port 31415
where IP is the ip of the device which runs the fortran code

In the driver.f90 you should set the correct ip of the device which runs the python code
host = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"//achar(0)
